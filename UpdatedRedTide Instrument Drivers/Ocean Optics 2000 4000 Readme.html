 href="http://www.ni.com/idnet">Instrument Driver Network</a>.<br>
<br>
REV 1.0, 11/12/2009<br>
Created by: Alvin Tang, Austin,TX.<br>
Original release.<br>
<br>
REV 1.0.1, 3/22/2010<br>
Modified by: Nathan T., Austin,TX.<br>
Updated Ocean Optics 2000 4000 Acquire Continuous Waveform VI by moving the wavelength calculation outside of the loop to improve performance.  Also added a note to the VI documentation for Read Spectral Waveform: <br>
<i>"Do not put this VI in a loop if performance is a concern.  Please see the <b>Ocean Optics 2000 4000 Acquire Continuous Waveform</b> example for an example of how to do continuous acquisition."</i><br>
<br>
REV 1.1.1, 04/26/2010<br>
Modified by: Nathan T., Austin,TX.<br>
Change Submitted by: HU<br>
Updated Read Spectra VI by re-working the conversion logic so that it is much faster (approximately 3000x faster).<br>
<br>
REV 1.1.2, 06/09/2010<br>
Modified by: Nathan T., Austin,TX.<br>
Change Submitted by: James G<br>
Updated Read Spectra VI by updating the Total Byte Check in the "Maya & Maya Pro Case" to 4608<br>
<br>
REV 1.2.0, 08/31/2010<br>
Modified by: Nathan T., Austin,TX.<br>

Created the following VIs for the ADC1000 Model: <br>
 &nbsp -Configure Master Clock Frequency <br>
 &nbsp -Configure Spectrometer Channel   <br>
 &nbsp -Read GPIO Input Pin              <br>
<br> 
REV 1.3.1, 09/12/2011 <br>
Modified by: Albert Geven<br>
Modifications:<br>
1) Read Spectra.vi - The merge errors function in the False case was connected in the wrong order.<br>
2) Query Wavelength Calibration Coefficient.vi - The merge errors function added to VI, so that errors on the conversion of strings from the instrument to a value are captured.<br>
<br> 
REV 1.3.2, 03/15/2013 <br>
Modified by: James Gass<br>
Change Submitted by: Shawn Shaw, Austin,TX.<br>
Moved ten pixels to the back of array to improve performance of VI and driver within Read Spectra.vi.
<br>
<br>
REV 1.3.3, 10/15/2013 <br>
Modified by: Albert Geven<br>
Modifications:<br>
1) Read Spectral Waveform -Previously assigned pixels to calculate wavelength are now using optical pixels instead of all pixels.<br> 
2) Read Spectra -Black pixel information and optical pixels are separated to give better results for measurements. <br>

<br>
REV 1.4, 11/15/2013 <br>
Modified by: Albert Geven, NI<br>
Modifications:<br>
1) Read Spectra VI (per REV 1.3.2) was obsoleted to avoid possible backwards compatibility issues.<br>
2) Read Optical Spectrum (Read Spectra Rev 1.3.3) was renamed to avoid possible issues. <br>
3) Read Spectral Waveform and Examples Ocean Optics 2000 4000 Process Spectrum, Ocean Optics 2000 4000 Log Spectrum, and Ocean Optics 2000 4000 Acquire Continuous Waveform were updated to use Read Optical Spectrum. <br>
